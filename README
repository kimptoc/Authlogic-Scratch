This is a simple example using authlogic (https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic) to show how to enable API type access to your Rails app.

See the examples in the lib/tasks/restclient directory for how the API would be used.

This is probably a duplication of one of the examples in https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic_example , but
I could not find it.

It uses the single_access_token.

The general procedure is to do a POST to /user_session with login/password details to login.

This returns user details in JSON format, including the single_access_token - which is then passed as the user_credentials
parameter in subsequent calls.
