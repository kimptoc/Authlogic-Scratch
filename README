This is a simple example using authlogic to show how to enable API type access to your Rails app.

See the examples in the restclient directory for how the API would be used.

This is probably a duplication of one of the examples in https://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic_example , but
I could not find it.

It uses the single_access_token.

The general procedure is to do a POST to /user_session with login/password details to login.

This returns user details in JSON format, including the single_access_token - which is then passed as the user_credentials
parameter in subsequent calls.

TODO
- add a user via API- does it work?
- add support for facebook, in particular via the API.
